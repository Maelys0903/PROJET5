"Replacing a 32-bit loop counter with 64-bit introduces crazy performance deviations with _mm_popcnt_u64 on Intel CPUs","<p>I was looking for the fastest way to <code>popcount</code> large arrays of data. I encountered a <em>very weird</em> effect: Changing the loop variable from <code>unsigned</code> to <code>uint64_t</code> made the performance drop by 50% on my PC.</p>

<h2>The Benchmark</h2>

<pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;

</code></pre>

<p>As you see, we create a buffer of random data, with the size being <code>x</code> megabytes where <code>x</code> is read from the command line. Afterwards, we iterate over the buffer and use an unrolled version of the x86 <code>popcount</code> intrinsic to perform the popcount. To get a more precise result, we do the popcount 10,000 times. We measure the times for the popcount. In the upper case, the inner loop variable is <code>unsigned</code>, in the lower case, the inner loop variable is <code>uint64_t</code>. I thought that this should make no difference, but the opposite is the case.</p>

<h2>The (absolutely crazy) results</h2>

<p>I compile it like this (g++ version: Ubuntu 4.8.2-19ubuntu1):</p>

<pre><code>g++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 test.cpp -o test
</code></pre>

<p>Here are the results on my <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Haswell</a> <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haswell_%28microarchitecture%29#Desktop_processors"" rel=""noreferrer"">Core i7-4770K</a> CPU @ 3.50&nbsp;GHz, running <code>test 1</code> (so 1&nbsp;MB random data):</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.401554 sec   <strong>26.113&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.759822 sec   <strong>13.8003&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>As you see, the throughput of the <code>uint64_t</code> version is <strong>only half</strong> the one of the <code>unsigned</code> version! The problem seems to be that different assembly gets generated, but why? First, I thought of a compiler bug, so I tried <code>clang++</code> (Ubuntu <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang"" rel=""noreferrer"">Clang</a> version 3.4-1ubuntu3):</p>

<pre><code>clang++ -O3 -march=native -std=c++11 teest.cpp -o test
</code></pre>

<p>Result: <code>test 1</code></p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.398293 sec   <strong>26.3267 GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.680954 sec   <strong>15.3986 GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>So, it is almost the same result and is still strange. <em>But now it gets super strange.</em> I replace the buffer size that was read from input with a constant <code>1</code>, so I change:</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t size = atol(argv[1]) &lt;&lt; 20;
</code></pre>

<p>to</p>

<pre><code>uint64_t size = 1 &lt;&lt; 20;
</code></pre>

<p>Thus, the compiler now knows the buffer size at compile time. Maybe it can add some optimizations! Here are the numbers for <code>g++</code>:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.509156 sec   <strong>20.5944&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.508673 sec   <strong>20.6139&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p>Now, both versions are equally fast. However, the <code>unsigned</code> <strong>got even slower</strong>! It dropped from <code>26</code> to <code>20 GB/s</code>, thus replacing a non-constant by a constant value lead to a <strong>deoptimization</strong>. Seriously, I have no clue what is going on here! But now to <code>clang++</code> with the new version:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.677009 sec   <strong>15.4884&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.676909 sec   <strong>15.4906&nbsp;GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Wait, what?</em> Now, both versions dropped to the <strong>slow</strong> number of 15&nbsp;GB/s. Thus, replacing a non-constant by a constant value even lead to slow code in <strong>both</strong> cases for Clang!</p>

<p>I asked a colleague with an <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivy_Bridge_%28microarchitecture%29"" rel=""noreferrer"">Ivy Bridge</a> CPU to compile my benchmark. He got similar results, so it does not seem to be Haswell. Because two compilers produce strange results here, it also does not seem to be a compiler bug. We do not have an AMD CPU here, so we could only test with Intel.</p>

<h2>More madness, please!</h2>

<p>Take the first example (the one with <code>atol(argv[1])</code>) and put a <code>static</code> before the variable, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>static uint64_t size=atol(argv[1])&lt;&lt;20;
</code></pre>

<p>Here are my results in g++:</p>

<ul>
<li>unsigned  41959360000  0.396728 sec   <strong>26.4306 GB/s</strong></li>
<li>uint64_t  41959360000  0.509484 sec   <strong>20.5811 GB/s</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><em>Yay, yet another alternative</em>. We still have the fast 26&nbsp;GB/s with <code>u32</code>, but we managed to get <code>u64</code> at least from the 13&nbsp;GB/s to the 20&nbsp;GB/s version! <strong>On my collegue's PC, the <code>u64</code> version became even faster than the <code>u32</code> version, yielding the fastest result of all.</strong> Sadly, this only works for <code>g++</code>, <code>clang++</code> does not seem to care about <code>static</code>.</p>

<h2>My question</h2>

<p>Can you explain these results? Especially:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can there be such a difference between <code>u32</code> and <code>u64</code>?</li>
<li>How can replacing a non-constant by a constant buffer size trigger <em>less optimal code</em>?</li>
<li>How can the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword make the <code>u64</code> loop faster? Even faster than the original code on my collegue's computer!</li>
</ul>

<p>I know that optimization is a tricky territory, however, I never thought that such small changes can lead to a <strong>100% difference</strong> in execution time and that small factors like a constant buffer size can again mix results totally. Of course, I always want to have the version that is able to popcount 26&nbsp;GB/s. The only reliable way I can think of is copy paste the assembly for this case and use inline assembly. This is the only way I can get rid of compilers that seem to go mad on small changes. What do you think? Is there another way to reliably get the code with most performance?</p>

<p>Interestingly, the fastest (26&nbsp;GB/s) version is also the longest! It seems to be the only solution that uses <code>lea</code>. Some versions use <code>jb</code> to jump, others use <code>jne</code>. But apart from that, all versions seem to be comparable. I don't see where a 100% performance gap could originate from, but I am not too adept at deciphering assembly. The slowest (13&nbsp;GB/s) version looks even very short and good. Can anyone explain this?</p>

<h2>Lessons learned</h2>

<p>No matter what the answer to this question will be; I have learned that in really hot loops <em>every</em> detail can matter, <em>even details that do not seem to have any association to the hot code</em>. I have never thought about what type to use for a loop variable, but as you see such a minor change can make a <em>100%</em> difference! Even the storage type of a buffer can make a huge difference, as we saw with the insertion of the <code>static</code> keyword in front of the size variable! In the future, I will always test various alternatives on various compilers when writing really tight and hot loops that are crucial for system performance.</p>

<p>The interesting thing is also that the performance difference is still so high although I have already unrolled the loop four times. So even if you unroll, you can still get hit by major performance deviations. Quite interesting.</p>

"Can't start Eclipse - Java was started but returned exit code=13","<p>I am trying to get my first taste of Android development using Eclipse. I ran into this problem when trying to run Eclipse, having installed version 4.2 only minutes ago.</p>

<p>After first trying to start <code>Eclipse</code> without any parameters to specify the Java VM, I got an error message saying it <code>couldn't find a Java VM called javaw.exe inside the Eclipse folder</code>, so I found where Java was installed and specified that location as the parameter in the shortcut's target. Now I get a different error, <code>Java was started but returned exit code=13</code>.</p>

<p>Similar questions seem to indicate that it's a 32-bit/64-bit conflict, but I'm 99% positive that I downloaded 64-bit versions of both Eclipse and <code>Java (RE 7u5)</code>, which I chose because I have 64-bit Windows 7. </p>

<ul>
<li>If anyone knows how to confirm that my Eclipse and Java are 64-bit,
that'd be appreciated.</li>

"Use of PUT vs PATCH methods in REST API real life scenarios","<p>First of all, some definitions:</p>
<p>PUT is defined in <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.6"" rel=""noreferrer"">Section 9.6 RFC 2616</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity <strong>SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server</strong>. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>PATCH is defined in <a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 5789</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The PATCH method requests that <strong>a set of changes</strong> described in the
request entity be applied to the resource identified by the Request-
URI.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Also according to <a href=""http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html#sec9.1.2"" rel=""noreferrer"">RFC 2616 Section 9.1.2</a> PUT is Idempotent while PATCH is not.</p>
<p>Now let us take a look at a real example. When I do POST to <code>/users</code> with the data <code>{username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code> and the server is capable of creating a resource, it will respond with 201 and resource location (lets assume <code>/users/1</code>) and any next call to GET <code>/users/1</code> will return <code>{id: 1, username: 'skwee357', email: 'skwee357@domain.example'}</code>.</p>
<p>Now let us say I want to modify my email. Email modification is considered &quot;a set of changes&quot; and therefore I should PATCH <code>/users/1</code> with &quot;<a href=""https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789#section-2"" rel=""noreferrer"">patch document</a>&quot;. In my case it would be the JSON document: <code>{email: 'skwee357@newdomain.example'}</code>. The server then returns 200 (assuming permission are ok). This brings me to first question:</p>
<ul>
<li>PATCH is NOT idempotent. It said so in RFC 2616 and RFC 5789. However if I issue the same PATCH request (with my new email), I will get the same resource state (with my email being modified to the requested value). Why is PATCH not then idempotent?</li>
</ul>
<p>PATCH is a relatively new verb (RFC introduced in March 2010), and it comes to solve the problem of &quot;patching&quot; or modifying a set of fields. Before PATCH was introduced, everybody used PUT to update resources. But after PATCH was introduced, it leaves me confused about what PUT is used for. And this brings me to my second (and the main) question:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is the real difference between PUT and PATCH? I have read somewhere that PUT might be used to <strong>replace</strong> entire entity under specific resource, so one should send the full entity (instead of set of attributes as with PATCH). What is the real practical usage for such case? When would you like to replace / overwrite an entity at a specific resource URI and why is such an operation not considered updating / patching the entity? The only practical use case I see for PUT is issuing a PUT on a collection, i.e. <code>/users</code> to replace the entire collection. Issuing PUT on a specific entity makes no sense after PATCH was introduced. Am I wrong?</li>

"Why is ""1000000000000000 in range(1000000000000001)"" so fast in Python 3?","<p>It is my understanding that the <code>range()</code> function, which is actually <a href=""https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#typesseq-range"" rel=""noreferrer"">an object type in Python 3</a>, generates its contents on the fly, similar to a generator.</p>
<p>This being the case, I would have expected the following line to take an inordinate amount of time because, in order to determine whether 1 quadrillion is in the range, a quadrillion values would have to be generated:</p>
<pre><code>1_000_000_000_000_000 in range(1_000_000_000_000_001)
</code></pre>
<p>Furthermore: it seems that no matter how many zeroes I add on, the calculation more or less takes the same amount of time (basically instantaneous).</p>
<p>I have also tried things like this, but the calculation is still almost instant:</p>
<pre><code># count by tens
1_000_000_000_000_000_000_000 in range(0,1_000_000_000_000_000_000_001,10)

"Is Safari on iOS 6 caching $.ajax results?","<p>Since the upgrade to iOS 6, we are seeing Safari's web view take the liberty of caching <code>$.ajax</code> calls. This is in the context of a PhoneGap application so it is using the Safari WebView. Our <code>$.ajax</code> calls are <code>POST</code> methods and we have cache set to false <code>{cache:false}</code>, but still this is happening. We tried manually adding a <code>TimeStamp</code> to the headers but it did not help.</p>
<p>We did more research and found that Safari is only returning cached results for web services that have a function signature that is static and does not change from call to call.  For instance, imagine a function called something like:</p>
<pre><code>getNewRecordID(intRecordType)
</code></pre>
<p>This function receives the same input parameters over and over again, but the data it returns should be different every time.</p>

<pre><code>getNewRecordID(intRecordType, strTimestamp)

<p>and then always pass in a <code>TimeStamp</code> parameter as well, and just discard that value on the server side.  This works around the issue.</p>

<p>This is a number of answers about warnings, errors, and notices you might encounter while programming PHP and have no clue how to fix them. This is also a Community Wiki, so everyone is invited to participate adding to and maintaining this list.</p>
<h3>Why is this?</h3>
<p>Questions like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12770075"">&quot;Headers already sent&quot;</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12769983"">&quot;Calling a member of a non-object&quot;</a> pop up frequently on Stack Overflow. The root cause of those questions is always the same. So the answers to those questions typically repeat them and then show the OP which line to change in their particular case. These answers do not add any value to the site because they only apply to the OP's particular code. Other users having the same error cannot easily read the solution out of it because they are too localized. That is sad because once you understood the root cause, fixing the error is trivial. Hence, this list tries to explain the solution in a general way to apply.</p>

<p>I did make functions named spam and eggs in their appropriate modules.  Naturally, it didn't work.  The answer is apparently in the 4th URL I listed, but it's all alumni to me. There was this response on one of the URLs I visited:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Relative imports use a module's name attribute to determine that module's position in the package hierarchy. If the module's name does not contain any package information (e.g. it is set to 'main') then relative imports are resolved as if the module were a top level module, regardless of where the module is actually located on the file system.</p>

"""Large data"" workflows using pandas","<p>I have tried to puzzle out an answer to this question for many months while learning pandas.  I use SAS for my day-to-day work and it is great for it's out-of-core support.  However, SAS is horrible as a piece of software for numerous other reasons.</p>

<p>One day I hope to replace my use of SAS with python and pandas, but I currently lack an out-of-core workflow for large datasets.  I'm not talking about ""big data"" that requires a distributed network, but rather files too large to fit in memory but small enough to fit on a hard-drive.</p>

<p>My first thought is to use <code>HDFStore</code> to hold large datasets on disk and pull only the pieces I need into dataframes for analysis.  Others have mentioned MongoDB as an easier to use alternative.  My question is this:</p>

<p>What are some best-practice workflows for accomplishing the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loading flat files into a permanent, on-disk database structure</li>
<li>Querying that database to retrieve data to feed into a pandas data structure</li>
<li>Updating the database after manipulating pieces in pandas</li>
</ol>

<p>Real-world examples would be much appreciated, especially from anyone who uses pandas on ""large data"".</p>

<p>Edit -- an example of how I would like this to work:</p>

<ol>
<li>Iteratively import a large flat-file and store it in a permanent, on-disk database structure.  These files are typically too large to fit in memory.</li>
<li>In order to use Pandas, I would like to read subsets of this data (usually just a few columns at a time) that can fit in memory.</li>
<li>I would create new columns by performing various operations on the selected columns.</li>
<li>I would then have to append these new columns into the database structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>I am trying to find a best-practice way of performing these steps. Reading links about pandas and pytables it seems that appending a new column could be a problem.</p>

<p>Edit -- Responding to Jeff's questions specifically:</p>

<ol>
<li>I am building consumer credit risk models. The kinds of data include phone, SSN and address characteristics; property values; derogatory information like criminal records, bankruptcies, etc... The datasets I use every day have nearly 1,000 to 2,000 fields on average of mixed data types: continuous, nominal and ordinal variables of both numeric and character data.  I rarely append rows, but I do perform many operations that create new columns.</li>
<li>Typical operations involve combining several columns using conditional logic into a new, compound column. For example, <code>if var1 &gt; 2 then newvar = 'A' elif var2 = 4 then newvar = 'B'</code>.  The result of these operations is a new column for every record in my dataset.</li>
<li>Finally, I would like to append these new columns into the on-disk data structure.  I would repeat step 2, exploring the data with crosstabs and descriptive statistics trying to find interesting, intuitive relationships to model.</li>
<li>A typical project file is usually about 1GB.  Files are organized into such a manner where a row consists of a record of consumer data.  Each row has the same number of columns for every record.  This will always be the case.</li>
<li>It's pretty rare that I would subset by rows when creating a new column.  However, it's pretty common for me to subset on rows when creating reports or generating descriptive statistics.  For example, I might want to create a simple frequency for a specific line of business, say Retail credit cards.  To do this, I would select only those records where the line of business = retail in addition to whichever columns I want to report on.  When creating new columns, however, I would pull all rows of data and only the columns I need for the operations.</li>
<li>The modeling process requires that I analyze every column, look for interesting relationships with some outcome variable, and create new compound columns that describe those relationships.  The columns that I explore are usually done in small sets.  For example, I will focus on a set of say 20 columns just dealing with property values and observe how they relate to defaulting on a loan.  Once those are explored and new columns are created, I then move on to another group of columns, say college education, and repeat the process.  What I'm doing is creating candidate variables that explain the relationship between my data and some outcome.  At the very end of this process, I apply some learning techniques that create an equation out of those compound columns.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is rare that I would ever add rows to the dataset.  I will nearly always be creating new columns (variables or features in statistics/machine learning parlance).</p>

<p>Is there a way to specify the types while converting the list to DataFrame? Or is it better to create the DataFrame first and then loop through the columns to change the dtype for each column? Ideally I would like to do this in a dynamic way because there can be hundreds of columns, and I don't want to specify exactly which columns are of which type. All I can guarantee is that each column contains values of the same type.</p>

"Why not inherit from List<T>?","<p>When planning out my programs, I often start with a chain of thought like so:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A football team is just a list of football players. Therefore, I should represent it with:</p>

<pre><code>var football_team = new List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;();
</code></pre>
  
  <p>The ordering of this list represent the order in which the players are listed in the roster.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I realize later that teams also have other properties, besides the mere list of players, that must be recorded. For example, the running total of scores this season, the current budget, the uniform colors, a <code>string</code> representing the name of the team, etc..</p>

<p>So then I think:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Okay, a football team is just like a list of players, but additionally, it has a name (a <code>string</code>) and a running total of scores (an <code>int</code>). .NET does not provide a class for storing football teams, so I will make my own class. The most similar and relevant existing structure is <code>List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt;</code>, so I will inherit from it:</p>

<pre><code>class FootballTeam : List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; 
{ 
    public string TeamName; 
    public int RunningTotal 
}
</code></pre>
</blockquote>

<p>But it turns out that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376343/1042555"">a guideline says you shouldn't inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code></a>. I'm thoroughly confused by this guideline in two respects.</p>

<h2>Why not?</h2>

<p>Apparently <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/5376358/1042555""><code>List</code> is somehow optimized for performance</a>. How so? What performance problems will I cause if I extend <code>List</code>? What exactly will break?</p>

<p>Another reason I've seen is that <code>List</code> is provided by Microsoft, and I have no control over it, so <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5376203/inherit-listt#comment6077237_5376343"">I cannot change it later, after exposing a ""public API""</a>. But I struggle to understand this. What is a public API and why should I care? If my current project does not and is not likely to ever have this public API, can I safely ignore this guideline? If I do inherit from <code>List</code> <em>and</em> it turns out I need a public API, what difficulties will I have?</p>

<p>Why does it even matter? A list is a list. What could possibly change? What could I possibly want to change?</p>

<p>And lastly, if Microsoft did not want me to inherit from <code>List</code>, why didn't they make the class <code>sealed</code>?</p>

<h2>What else am I supposed to use?</h2>

<p>Apparently, for custom collections, Microsoft has provided a <code>Collection</code> class which should be extended instead of <code>List</code>. But this class is very bare, and does not have many useful things, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1474863/addrange-to-a-collection"">such as <code>AddRange</code></a>, for instance. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/12039943/1042555"">jvitor83's answer</a> provides a performance rationale for that particular method, but how is a slow <code>AddRange</code> not better than no <code>AddRange</code>?</p>

<p>Inheriting from <code>Collection</code> is way more work than inheriting from <code>List</code>, and I see no benefit. Surely Microsoft wouldn't tell me to do extra work for no reason, so I can't help feeling like I am somehow misunderstanding something, and inheriting <code>Collection</code> is actually not the right solution for my problem.</p>

<p>I've seen suggestions such as implementing <code>IList</code>. Just no. This is dozens of lines of boilerplate code which gains me nothing.</p>

<p>Lastly, some suggest wrapping the <code>List</code> in something: </p>

<pre><code>class FootballTeam 
{ 
    public List&lt;FootballPlayer&gt; Players; 
}
</code></pre>

<p>There are two problems with this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It makes my code needlessly verbose. I must now call <code>my_team.Players.Count</code> instead of just <code>my_team.Count</code>. Thankfully, with C# I can define indexers to make indexing transparent, and forward all the methods of the internal <code>List</code>... But that's a lot of code! What do I get for all that work?</p></li>
<li><p>It just plain doesn't make any sense. A football team doesn't ""have"" a list of players. It <em>is</em> the list of players. You don't say ""John McFootballer has joined SomeTeam's players"". You say ""John has joined SomeTeam"". You don't add a letter to ""a string's characters"", you add a letter to a string. You don't add a book to a library's books, you add a book to a library.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I realize that what happens ""under the hood"" can be said to be ""adding X to Y's internal list"", but this seems like a very counter-intuitive way of thinking about the world.</p>

<h2>My question (summarized)</h2>

<p>What is the correct C# way of representing a data structure, which, ""logically"" (that is to say, ""to the human mind"") is just a <code>list</code> of <code>things</code> with a few bells and whistles?</p>

<p>Is inheriting from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> always unacceptable? When is it acceptable? Why/why not? What must a programmer consider, when deciding whether to inherit from <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> or not?</p>

"How do you keep parents of floated elements from collapsing?","<p>Although elements like <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>s normally grow to fit their contents, using the <code>float</code> property can cause a startling problem for CSS newbies: <strong>If floated elements have non-floated parent elements, the parent will collapse.</strong></p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p>The parent div in this example will <strong>not expand</strong> to contain its floated children - it will appear to have <code>height: 0</code>.</p>
<h1>How do you solve this problem?</h1>
<p><em>I would like to create an exhaustive list of solutions here. If you're aware of cross-browser compatibility issues, please point them out.</em></p>
<h2>Solution 1</h2>
<p>Float the parent.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: You may not always want the parent floated. Even if you do, do you float the parents' parent, and so on? Must you float every ancestor element?</p>
<h2>Solution 2</h2>
<p>Give the parent an explicit height.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""height: 300px;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Semantic code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not flexible - if the content changes or the browser is resized, the layout will break.</p>
<h2>Solution 3</h2>
<p>Append a &quot;spacer&quot; element inside the parent element, like this:</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div class=""spacer"" style=""clear: both;""&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Straightforward to code.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Not semantic; the spacer div exists only as a layout hack.</p>
<h2>Solution 4</h2>
<p>Set parent to <code>overflow: auto</code>.</p>
<p><div class=""snippet"" data-lang=""js"" data-hide=""false"" data-console=""true"" data-babel=""false"">
<div class=""snippet-code"">
<pre class=""snippet-code-html lang-html prettyprint-override""><code>&lt;div style=""overflow: auto;""&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 1&lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;div style=""float: left;""&gt;Div 2&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong>: Doesn't require extra div.<br />
<strong>Cons</strong>: Seems like a hack - that's not the <code>overflow</code> property's stated purpose.</p>

"What's the difference between faking, mocking, and stubbing?","<p>I know how I use these terms, but I'm wondering if there are accepted definitions for <strong>faking</strong>, <strong>mocking</strong>, and <strong>stubbing</strong> for unit tests?  How do you define these for your tests?  Describe situations where you might use each.</p>
<p>Here is how I use them:</p>
<p><strong>Fake</strong>: a class that implements an interface but contains fixed data and no logic.  Simply returns &quot;good&quot; or &quot;bad&quot; data depending on the implementation.</p>
<p><strong>Mock</strong>: a class that implements an interface and allows the ability to dynamically set the values to return/exceptions to throw from particular methods and provides the ability to check if particular methods have been called/not called.</p>
<p><strong>Stub</strong>: Like a mock class, except that it doesn't provide the ability to verify that methods have been called/not called.</p>
<p>Generation of each:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mocks</strong> and <strong>Stubs</strong> can be hand-generated or generated by a mocking framework.</li>
<li><strong>Fake classes</strong> are generated by hand.</li>
</ul>
<p>Using them as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mocks</strong> primarily to verify interactions between my class and dependent classes.</li>
<li><strong>Stubs</strong> once I have verified the interactions and am testing alternate paths through my code.</li>
<li><strong>Fake classes</strong> primarily to abstract out data dependencies or when mocks/stubs are too tedious to set up each time.</li>

"How Can I add HTML And CSS Into PDF","<p>I have an HTML (not XHTML) document that renders fine in Firefox 3 and IE 7.  It uses fairly basic CSS to style it and renders fine in HTML.</p>

<p>I'm now after a way of converting it to PDF.  I have tried:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/dompdf/dompdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">DOMPDF</a>: it had huge problems with tables.  I factored out my large nested tables and it helped (before it was just consuming up to 128M of memory then dying--thats my limit on memory in php.ini) but it makes a complete mess of tables and doesn't seem to get images.  The tables were just basic stuff with some border styles to add some lines at various points;</li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/spipu/html2pdf"" rel=""noreferrer"">HTML2PDF and HTML2PS</a>: I actually had better luck with this.  It rendered some of the images (all the images are Google Chart URLs) and the table formatting was much better but it seemed to have some complexity problem I haven't figured out yet and kept dying with unknown node_type() errors.  Not sure where to go from here; and</li>
<li><a href=""http://www.msweet.org/projects.php?Z1"" rel=""noreferrer"">Htmldoc</a>: this seems to work fine on basic HTML but has almost no support for CSS whatsoever so you have to do everything in HTML (I didn't realize it was still 2001 in Htmldoc-land...) so it's useless to me.</li>
</ul>

"Strange OutOfMemory issue while loading an image to a Bitmap object","<p>I have a <code>ListView</code> with a couple of image buttons on each row. When the user clicks the list row, it launches a new activity. I have had to build my own tabs because of an issue with the camera layout. The activity that gets launched for the result is a map. If I click on my button to launch the image preview (load an image off the SD card) the application returns from the activity back to the <code>ListView</code> activity to the result handler to relaunch my new activity which is nothing more than an image widget.</p>
<p>The image preview on the <code>ListView</code> is being done with the cursor and <code>ListAdapter</code>. This makes it pretty simple, but I am not sure how I can put a resized image (I.e. Smaller bit size not pixel as the <code>src</code> for the image button on the fly. So I just resized the image that came off the phone camera.</p>
<p>The issue is that I get an <code>OutOfMemoryError</code> when it tries to go back and re-launch the 2nd activity.</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there a way I can build the list adapter easily row by row, where I can resize on the fly (<em>bitwise</em>)?</li>
</ul>
<p>This would be preferable as I also need to make some changes to the properties of the widgets/elements in each row as I am unable to select a row with the touch screen because of the focus issue. (<em>I can use rollerball.</em>)</p>
<ul>
<li>I know I can do an out of band resize and save my image, but that is not really what I want to do, but some sample code for that would be nice.</li>
</ul>
<p>As soon as I disabled the image on the <code>ListView</code> it worked fine again.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Collection was modified; enumeration operation may not execute</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Below is the code.</p>
<p>This is a WCF server in a Windows service. The method <code>NotifySubscribers()</code> is called by the service whenever there is a data event (at random intervals, but not very often - about 800 times per day).</p>
<p>When a Windows Forms client subscribes, the subscriber ID is added to the subscribers dictionary, and when the client unsubscribes, it is deleted from the dictionary. The error happens when (or after) a client unsubscribes. It appears that the next time the <code>NotifySubscribers()</code> method is called, the <code>foreach()</code> loop fails with the error in the subject line. The method writes the error into the application log as shown in the code below. When a debugger is attached and a client unsubscribes, the code executes fine.</p>

"How can I make a UITextField move up when the keyboard is present - on starting to edit?","<p>With the iOS SDK:</p>
<p>I have a <code>UIView</code> with <code>UITextField</code>s that bring up a keyboard. I need it to be able to:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Allow scrolling of the contents of the <code>UIScrollView</code> to see the other text fields once the keyboard is brought up</p>
</li>
<li><p>Automatically &quot;jump&quot; (by scrolling up) or shortening</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I know that I need a <code>UIScrollView</code>.  I've tried changing the class of my <code>UIView</code> to a <code>UIScrollView</code>, but I'm still unable to scroll the textboxes up or down.</p>
<p>Do I need both a <code>UIView</code> and a <code>UIScrollView</code>? Does one go inside the other?</p>
<p>What needs to be implemented in order to automatically scroll to the active text field?</p>
<p>Ideally as much of the setup of the components as possible will be done in Interface Builder. I'd like to only write code for what needs it.</p>
<p>Note: the <code>UIView</code> (or <code>UIScrollView</code>) that I'm working with is brought up by a tabbar (<code>UITabBar</code>), which needs to function as normal.</p>

<pre><code>-(void)textFieldDidBeginEditing:(UITextField *)textField {
    //Keyboard becomes visible
    scrollView.frame = CGRectMake(scrollView.frame.origin.x,
                                  scrollView.frame.origin.y,
    scrollView.frame.size.width,
    scrollView.frame.size.height - 215 + 50);   // Resize

"'Must Override a Superclass Method' Errors after importing a project into Eclipse","<p>Anytime I have to re-import my projects into Eclipse (if I reinstalled Eclipse, or changed the location of the projects), <strong>almost all</strong> of my overridden methods are not formatted correctly, causing the error:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The method must override a superclass method</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It may be noteworthy to mention this is with Android projects for whatever reason, the method argument values are not always populated, so I have to manually populate them myself. For instance:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //These arguments have their correct names
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu menu, View v, 
                                    ContextMenuInfo menuInfo) {                 
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>will be initially populated like this:</p>

<pre><code>list.setOnCreateContextMenuListener(new OnCreateContextMenuListener() {

    //This methods arguments were not automatically provided    
    public void onCreateContextMenu(ContextMenu arg1, View arg2,
                                    ContextMenuInfo arg3) {
    }

});
</code></pre>

<p>The odd thing is, if I remove my code, and have Eclipse automatically recreate the method, it uses the same argument names I already had, so I don't really know where the problem is, other then it auto-formatting the method for me.</p>

<p>This becomes quite a pain having to manually recreate ALL my overridden methods by hand. If anyone can explain why this happens or how to fix it. I would be very happy.</p>

<p>Maybe it is due to the way I am formatting the methods, which are inside an argument of another method?</p>

"Daylight saving time and time zone best practices","<p>I am hoping to make this question and the answers to it the definitive guide to dealing with daylight saving time, in particular for dealing with the actual change overs. </p>

<p><strong>If you have anything to add, please do</strong></p>

<p>Many systems are dependent on keeping accurate time, the problem is with changes to time due to daylight savings - moving the clock forward or backwards.</p>

<p>For instance, one has business rules in an order taking system that depend on the time of the order - if the clock changes, the rules might not be as clear. How should the time of the order be persisted? There are of course an endless number of scenarios - this one is simply an illustrative one.</p>

<ul>
<li>How have you dealt with the daylight saving issue? </li>
<li>What assumptions are part of your solution? (looking for context here)</li>
</ul>

<p>As important, if not more so:</p>

<ul>
<li>What did you try that did not work? </li>
<li>Why did it not work?</li>
</ul>

<p>I would be interested in programming, OS, data persistence and other pertinent aspects of the issue.</p>

<p>General answers are great, but I would also like to see details especially if they are only available on one platform.</p>

<p>Currently, we have a standard way of dealing with .NET <code>DateTime</code>s in a TimeZone-aware way: Whenever we produce a <code>DateTime</code> we do it in UTC (e.g. using <code>DateTime.UtcNow</code>), and whenever we display one, we convert back from UTC to the user's local time.</p>
<p>That works fine, but I've been reading about <code>DateTimeOffset</code> and how it captures the local and UTC time in the object itself.</p>

</ul>
<p>Cons</p>

<li>It's a true class</li>
<li>Auto-magically covers inheritance</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons</p>
<ul>
<li>Is there not an overhead for creating each new class? Here we are creating two classes for each class we wish to make a singleton. While this is fine in my case, I worry that this might not scale. Of course there is a matter of debate as to whether it aught to be too easy to scale this pattern...</li>
<li>What is the point of the <code>_sealed</code> attribute</li>
<li>Can't call methods of the same name on base classes using <code>super()</code> because they will recurse. This means you can't customize <code>__new__</code> and can't subclass a class that needs you to call up to <code>__init__</code>.</li>

"UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)","<p>I'm having problems dealing with unicode characters from text fetched from different web pages (on different sites). I am using BeautifulSoup. </p>

<p>The problem is that the error is not always reproducible; it sometimes works with some pages, and sometimes, it barfs by throwing a <code>UnicodeEncodeError</code>. I have tried just about everything I can think of, and yet I have not found anything that works consistently without throwing some kind of Unicode-related error.</p>

<p>One of the sections of code that is causing problems is shown below:</p>

<pre><code>agent_telno = agent.find('div', 'agent_contact_number')
agent_telno = '' if agent_telno is None else agent_telno.contents[0]
p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
</code></pre>

<p>Here is a stack trace produced on SOME strings when the snippet above is run:</p>

<pre><code>Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""foobar.py"", line 792, in &lt;module&gt;
    p.agent_info = str(agent_contact + ' ' + agent_telno).strip()
UnicodeEncodeError: 'ascii' codec can't encode character u'\xa0' in position 20: ordinal not in range(128)
</code></pre>

<p>I suspect that this is because some pages (or more specifically, pages from some of the sites) may be encoded, whilst others may be unencoded. All the sites are based in the UK and provide data meant for UK consumption - so there are no issues relating to internalization or dealing with text written in anything other than English.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any ideas as to how to solve this so that I can CONSISTENTLY fix this problem?</p>

"Why is processing a sorted array faster than processing an unsorted array?","<p>In this C++ code, sorting the data (<em>before</em> the timed region) makes the primary loop ~6x faster:</p>

    int data[arraySize];

    for (unsigned c = 0; c &lt; arraySize; ++c)
        data[c] = std::rand() % 256;

    // !!! With this, the next loop runs faster.

<li>With the sorted data, the code runs in 1.93 seconds.</li>
</ul>
<p>(Sorting itself takes more time than this one pass over the array, so it's not actually worth doing if we needed to calculate this for an unknown array.)</p>

<p>With a similar but less extreme result.</p>
<hr />
<p>My first thought was that sorting brings the data into the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CPU_cache"" rel=""noreferrer"">cache</a>, but that's silly because the array was just generated.</p>
<ul>
<li>What is going on?</li>

<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/66521344"">Why is processing an unsorted array the same speed as processing a sorted array with modern x86-64 clang?</a> - <strong>modern C++ compilers auto-vectorize the loop</strong>, especially when SSE4.1 or AVX2 is available.  This avoids any data-dependent branching so performance isn't data-dependent.</li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/28875325"">gcc optimization flag -O3 makes code slower than -O2</a> - branchless scalar with <code>cmov</code> can result in a longer dependency chain (especially when GCC chooses poorly), creating a latency bottleneck that makes it slower than branchy asm for the sorted case.</li>
